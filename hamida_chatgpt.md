## **Logical Flow (System Workflow)**

### **1. User Onboarding**

* User visits app or site → registers account → system creates wallet → user selects role (shopkeeper, driver, customer) → prompts for subscription if required.

### **2. Product Browsing & Shopping**

* Customer logs in → browses/searches products → views details, ratings, and reviews → adds item to cart → proceeds to checkout.

### **3. Checkout and Payment**

* Customer initiates payment → funds deducted from wallet → order stored in pending state → shopkeeper gets notified → customer confirms receipt → funds transferred to shopkeeper.

### **4. Subscription Flow**

* System checks wallets monthly → deducts subscription → if failed, user account deactivated → notification sent → reactivation upon wallet refill.

### **5. AI Recommendation (Post-100 Transactions)**

* System logs all transactions → rule-based model trained → model generates suggestions → displayed on homepage or product pages.

### **6. Admin & Maintenance**

* Admin logs in → checks storage, user metrics, backups → performs scheduled data backup → monitors inactive/low-balance accounts.
